Tetran

Text/console falling-block tetromino game written in Modern Fortran.
It has diverged and been enhanced considerably from L. Bobberman's original demo.

   :alt: Tetran gameplay demo

* user-configurable playfield size
* Logs pieces played to ``tetran.log`` so you can recreate memorable games.
* uniform random game piece generation.
* clean, modern Fortran 2008 syntax
* Ncurses used for display, called directly from Fortran code (this is a blocker for native Windows).

Prereq
======
Tetran works on Mac, Linux, Cygwin and Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Any modern Fortran compiler (including Flang with CMake >= 3.10) should work.


* Linux / WSL: ``apt install gfortran libncurses-dev``
* Mac: ``brew install gcc ncurses``
* Cygwin: ``setup-x86_64.exe -P libncurses-devel cmake make gcc-gfortran``


Build
=====

.. code:: bash

    cd bin
    cmake ..
    make
    make test


Optional: specify a compiler by setting ``FC=``.

* Intel: ``FC=ifort cmake ..``
* Flang: ``FC=flang cmake ..``
* PGI: ``FC=pgf95 cmake ..``



Play
====

.. code:: bash

    ./tetran


difficulty level
----------------
adjust cadence of falling blocks with ``-d`` option, including decimal point:

.. code:: bash

    ./tetran -d 1.2

Higher number => more difficult. 
Must include decimal point.

Playfield size
--------------
specify width and height of the playfield with ``-s`` option:

.. code:: bash

    ./tetran -s 20 15
    
debug mode
----------
Debug logging is enabled by:

.. code:: bash

    ./tetran --debug



Controls
--------

Other "secret" cheat keys exist!
You can also use arrow keys.

========= ======
Key       Effect
========= ======
W         Rotate piece
A/D       Left and right respectively
S         Move down faster
Q or Esc  Exit the game
========= ======


Notes
=====

Block Randomness
----------------
unlike some games, block distribution is uniformly random as confirmed by::

  ./blockrand
  
Normalized benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
using ``time ./blockrand 100000000`` *relative normalized* execution times were:

``-O3``::

  GNU   1.00 (fastest normalized)
  Flang 1.90
  PGI:  1.82 
  ifort 8.22
  
Tested with:

* Intel Haswell laptop CPU
* Flang 5.0
* Gfortran 7.3
* Intel Fortran 2019
* PGI 2018
  
So Intel Fortran takes over 5 times longer than Gfortran at this simple single-thread benchmark.
